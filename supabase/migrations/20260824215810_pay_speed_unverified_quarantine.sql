-- get_billed_customer_pay_speeds v5 — quarantine unverified import-era
-- same-day pairs (v2.2248; v4 was 20260824185156).
--
-- The HCP jobs-export import wrote job-level "paid in full" dates as
-- paid_on; the invoice backfill dated bills by HCP send dates. When both
-- derive from the same bookkeeping moment the pair reads "paid in 0 days" —
-- an artifact, not a speed (owner-confirmed 2026-08-24). v5 excludes from
-- the samples any payment that is
--   * dated on/before its bill day, AND
--   * typed from the import ('HCP import', 'HCP', …), AND
--   * not re-dated from the HCP payments report
--     (notes tagged hcp-paydate-corrected / hcp-payments-split).
-- Genuine same-day payments still count: bank-dated (Mercury), Stripe,
-- report-corrected, and app-recorded rows are untouched — the verified data
-- shows on-the-spot payment is real and common.
--
-- Everything else (medians, segments, customerTypes, receipts shape, the
-- role gate) is unchanged from v4.
