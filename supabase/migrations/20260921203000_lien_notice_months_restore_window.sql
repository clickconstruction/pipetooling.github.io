-- Lien desk (v2.3683): restore the notice RPC's job-level window. 20260921193000
-- (v2.3680) was written from the v2.3405 body and replaced the function on prod, which
-- silently undid v2.3412's widening (20260914190000): a job counts when it is billed OR
-- has a billed invoice, and once any of its months is inside the look-ahead window every
-- unnoticed month with an open window rides along, so a notice for June can name July
-- and August. Same-day regression, seen on job 258 (August vanished). This is that body
-- again, plus v2.3680's rule: a closed month that is unnoticed and unrecorded (no skip,
-- no noted miss) stays since the desk went live (2026-09-14) — and such a month brings
-- its job into the window on its own.
